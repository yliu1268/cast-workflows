# Phenotype preprocessing for AoU

This script takes as input a phenotype ID and runs preprocessing to create a file with phenotype values and phenotype-specific covariates ready to be used for GWAS or other applications. 


## Usage

**Note, this must be run on the AoU workbench.** You can use a minimal analysis environment (e.g. 4 CPU, 15GB RAM).

Usage example:

```
./aou_phenotype_preprocessing.py \
   --phenotype ALT \
   --concept-id 37047736 \
   --units blood \
   --range 0,250 \
   [--drugexposure-covariate-concept-ids 21601855:statin] \
   [--sample samplefile.txt]
```

Required arguments: 

* `--phenotype <STR>`: phenotype ID to use to name the output file
* `--concept-id <INT>`: must be obtained from the AoU workbench data browser (TODO: add instructions)
* `--units <STR>`: comma-separated list of units to allow. Shortcut `--units blood` allows units: "IU/L", "No matching concept", "international unit per liter", "no value", "unit per liter". TODO: Might change this based on units for other phenotypes
* `--range <INT,INT>`: Minimum and maximum accepted values for the phenotype

Optional arguments:
* `--sample <FILE>`: file with list of samples to restrict to (one ID per line). Typically this would a list of samples that passed upstream sample-level QC info.
* `--drugexposure-covariate-concept-ids <STR>`: List of conceptid:conceptname to use as drug exposure covariates.

The output file will is a csv file named `${phenotype}_phenocovar.csv` with columns: "person_id", "phenotype", "age", plus an additional column for each drug exposure named by the "conceptname" provided for that drug. e.g. the example above will have columns "person_id", "phenotype", "age", "statin".

## Running on multiple phenotypes

```
./process_phenotypes.py quantitative_phenotypes.csv
```

The file `quantitative_phenotypes.csv` is a csv file with named columns:
* `phenotype`
* `concept_id`
* `units`
* `min`
* `max`
* `drugcovars`

The script above will run phenotype preprocessing on each one, store results of each one at `${WORKSPACE_BUCKET}/phenotypes/${phenotype}_phenocovar.csv`, and output the file `quantitative_phenotypes.manifest.csv` which can be used to update the master manifest file in the above directory.
